<h1>About Tech Connect</h1>
<p>Technology is playing a greater and greater role in mission strategies worldwide. Technology is becoming increasingly common even among the impoverished.  There are significant strategic opportunities to multiply the impact of personnel by providing them, gccs and national partners with reproducible technology solutions that purposefully integrate with front line strategy.  Because GTS resources are limited and, as such, must remain focused on “global” priorities, technological needs limited to a specific unit, team, cluster or language/target entity cannot typically be met by personnel or teams within GTS.  This means that strategic technological needs of front line workers regularly go unmet unless they have a connection to “outside” resources that can meet those needs or have the expertise to meet their own needs.  In cases where the needs are met, the solutions are rarely available to other users that might benefit and the long-term support of the solution may or may not be adequate for future use of those solutions.
    However, there are experts within the Body of Christ (i.e., attending partner churches, working with like-minded organizations, etc.) that are looking to maximize the use of their gifts and abilities for the sake of the Kingdom of God.  This initiative will create opportunities to cast organizational vision with like-minded churches and invite them to be directly and significantly involved in reaching the nations with the Gospel.
    The establishment of a team focused on leveraging the expertise of volunteers within partner churches and like-minded organizations (i.e., “partners”) to meet the technological needs of front line workers would allow GTS to remain focused on global priorities while simultaneously working to meet the strategic technological needs of affinities, clusters, teams, individual units or specific people groups.
